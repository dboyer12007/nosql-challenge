# nosql-challenge
Originally when looking to find an element I just used establishments.find({"BusinessName": "Penang Flavours"}) to find the new restaurant and got a cursor object. I then learned using list allowed you to view the entire part of the document.
I had to research how to do the last command in the NoSQL_setup_starter part of the challenge where it asked to check that coordinates and ratings were now numbers.
